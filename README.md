**LunchBox - The homemade food delivery**


**Design Challenge:**
Ensure Healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages:

In today’s hectic lifestyle people easily forgets about the most important aspect of life – “Health”, which begins with a healthy diet. In Northern America, almost 38.41% of the population is consuming fast food at least three times a week. People easily avoid a healthy diet which is essential for well-being to save time for their work, studies, and even for entertainment. Eating unhygienic food such as canned food with preservatives can lead to long-term health problems which can be easily avoided with proper intake of regularly maintained food consumption. Thinking about the healthiness of the food a proper diet and food containing the regulated amount of nutrition can also help many individuals with hygienic problems, athletes, and health-conscious people.

**Idea:**

To tackle this problem, we offer a system that is focused on homemade food delivery – “The Lunch Box”. The main focus of the idea is to introduce a healthy lifestyle in terms of homemade food service where target audiences could be International Students, Athletes, and Poor People. The people with hectic schedules and old age people could also be a part of the customer segment.  This platform provides options to select the 7 days meal generation from several options considering diet and nutrition with offering food delivery. Apart from that, membership subscriptions – Gold, Silver, Platinum can attract customers by providing offers on weekdays, free delivery, and nutrition advice. One of the major key features of our system is people can include their occupation, disease, diet plans to get the food accordingly. Proper diet and hygienic food can be the first step towards a healthy lifestyle.
